# layout "name":
#   x, y, width, height, column, row;
#
# Values are percentage, and number of columns/rows.
# The name field is used to set the layout variable (see below), do not use
# whitespaces.
# Each line represents the window index, i.e. first line, first window.
# The information is separated with semicolon, the part to be used depends upon
# the window index and the total number of windows.
# The first part, of the first line is used when there is only one window, if a
# second one is created, the second part is used to arrange the first window.
# The second part part of the second line is used on the second window when
# there is three windows. (i.e. total - current + 1)
# If the number exceeds, the last one is used.
# To automatically arrange the exceeded windows, one must provide the column
# and row numbers, only at the last line, otherwise it will have no effect.
# If the number is zero, the row/column number is choosed dynamically,
# otherwise, it uses the provide number.
# Just be sure to not define a number on both fields, as it is impossible to
# create, for example, a grid with 2x2 using 1 or 10 windows.

# Float window is the opposite, it stays on top, covering normal and sink
# windows, and it does not arrange using the layout, but is rather managed
# using the mouse, by the user (it is also possible with keyboard, of course),
# float window is the common window type in most of window managers.
